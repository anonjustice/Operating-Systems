The Boot Up process
After an electrical current resets the processor chip, the firmware provides start-up instructions. 
Various pieces of hardware, and peripheral devices, are then checked to ensure they are in good shape.
The kernal of the operating system is then loaded from internal storage to the RAM.
The kernal is the 'boss' of the OS and manages memory, devices, and assigns resources.
